# regov-coding-challenge
Hello! This repo is my submission for my internship placement at ReGov Technologies for the software engineer position. I used Laragon to host PHP and phpMyAdmin locally.

## My Solution
After reading the questions, I noticed that both of them have similar requirements. So, I did both questions and combined them under one project. The following are the summary of the files/folders:
1. ```class/``` - Holds ```classes.php``` which contains the class for use in user authentication
2. ```sql/``` - Contains the exported database table. The table contains some dummy login data. To import in phpMyAdmin, create a database named ```regov```. Then, import the table in the .sql file into the database.
3. ```util/``` - Contains ```db.php``` and ```functions.php```
   - ```db.php``` - Creates the database connection variable in php
   -  ```functions.php``` - Contains methods for code that are reused in multiple places
4. ```style.css``` - Defines the background colours
5. ```dashboard.php```, ```index.php```, ```logout.php```, ```register.php``` - The main features

Thank you for your time.
